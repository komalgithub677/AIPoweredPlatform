🚀 Collaborative AI-Powered Ideation & Project Management Platform

An advanced, intelligent platform built to elevate brainstorming, task planning & team workflow automation. Powered by MERN + AI Integration (Gemini / ChatGPT API) for smart real-time ideation and project execution.

📌 Overview

Most project-management tools track tasks — but cannot think, suggest, or ideate like a human brain.

This platform solves that.

It transforms raw ideas into structured tasks using LLM-powered AI and enables teams to collaborate, visualize, plan & manage projects in one connected system.

✔ AI-driven Ideation ✔ Auto-generated tasks from ideas ✔ Kanban workflow management ✔ Real-time collaboration (Chat + Teams + Notifications) ✔ Analytics Dashboard for insights & performance
